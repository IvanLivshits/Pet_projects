      <p>
        Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both
        And be one traveler, long I stood And looked down one as far as I could
        To where it bent in the undergrowth. Then took the other, as just as
        fair, And having perhaps the better claim, Because it was grassy and
        wanted wear; Though as for that the passing there Had worn them really
        about the same. And both that morning equally lay In leaves no step had
        trodden black. Oh, I kept the first for another day! Yet knowing how way
        leads on to way, I doubted if I should ever come back. I shall be
        telling this with a sigh Somewhere ages and ages hence: Two roads
        diverged in a wood, and I‚Äî I took the one less traveled by, And that has
        made all the difference.
